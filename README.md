# Bangla_Image_Caption_Generator

This project is our semester project for Machine Learning (CSE 4622) course. For this project we used CNN based encoder and LSTM as decoders to predict what is happening in an image.
This is also known as image captioning. For various models of CNN (Encoders), we ran our models on 2 datasets BANCAP and BanglaLekha and evaluated the performance of the models on the two datasets. BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) was used to evaluate the similarity between the reference captions and the predicted captions. This project combines the concepts of both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). And as fewer researches are done in Bangla, this project becomes crucial in both these domains of CV and NLP.

Instructions for repository:
----------------------------------
1. The Bancap folder contains all the model(ipynb) files ran on the bancap dataset
2. The BanglaLekha folder contains all the model(ipynb) files ran on the bancap dataset

For convenience and to show easily the demo of our machine learning model, we used GRADIO. All the ipynb files are given according to their respective folders
